# Java OOP Project – Day 1

This project demonstrates the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java.

## OOP Principles Used:
- Encapsulation – Fields are kept private and accessed via getters and setters.
- Inheritance – Student and Teacher classes inherit from the Person base class.
- Polymorphism – The showInfo() method is shared and can be overridden for specific behaviors.

## Classes:
- Person – Stores name and age.
- Student – Adds a university field.
- Teacher – Adds a subject field.

## How It Works:
1. Student and Teacher objects are created in the Main class.
2. Data is entered using setter methods.
3. Information is printed using the showInfo() method.

## Sample Output:
Lamie 19 ADNSU
AIDAN 36 OOP

### Usage
This is an educational project designed for beginners learning Java and OOP concepts.
